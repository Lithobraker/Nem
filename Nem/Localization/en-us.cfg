		#LOC_Nem_General_Name = Nem^N
		#LOC_Nem_General_Description = Nem is Eve's smaller binary companion, and a planet in its own right. Though maybe it's a stretch to call it Kerbin's twin, it could reasonably be called Kerbin's estranged cousin. At about a quarter of its mass and half its atmospheric pressure, Nem's conditions are hostile, but survivable. It's even possible- though unlikely- that the planet harbors life on the surface!
		#LOC_Nem_General_GillyDescription = Gilly is a lumpy rock closely circling Nem. It was first discovered when astronomers noticed Nem would dim slightly every so often. Due to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has now become synonymous with being an accomplished astronomer.
		#LOC_Nem_General_EveDescription = Eve is part of a binary planet system with Nem, its much smaller and less inhospitable partner. In stark contrast to Nem's comfortable gravity, survivable pressure, and manageable temperatures, Eve has too much gravioli, extreme pressure, and it's far, far too hot for comfort. It's about as unforgiving as a terrestrial planet gets!
		#LOC_Nem_General_GillyPrincipiaDescription = Gilly is a lumpy rock sharing an orbit with Eve. If you count it as a moon of Eve thanks to orbiting in its L5 lagrange point, it's by far the smallest natural satellite that the Kerbal Astronomical Society has discovered. Due to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has now become synonymous with being an accomplished astronomer.

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_bothMagnetometer_Nem_InSpaceLow = Nem has a very strong magnetic field for its size, which seems to be plenty strong enough to protect its atmosphere from the solar wind.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_bothMagnetometer_Nem_InSpaceHigh = As you pass through Nem's shadow, the sensor picks up a surprisingly powerful reading. It appears Nem has a pretty strong magnetic field.
		
        // Stock
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedDuneSeas = I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedWhiteDeserts = This blinding white desert is unsettlingly barren. You half expect a bloated, alien monstrosity to come floating by and abduct you or something.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = Is it getting hot in here, or is it just me?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedMaria = The dark maria outside is a nice reprieve from the searing bright colors of other areas. It's probably hotter, though.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedAbydaMare = You wonder if this desert is hiding any pyramid-shaped spaceships, or ancient alien portals to other planets!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedCraters = "No, Mission Control, this crater was here before we landed, I swear!"
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = For a moment, you mistook those plants for palm trees. They're definitely convergent, but not the same.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedCanyons = The scenery outside is surprisingly nice for a desert, but you're just hoping you don't hit a canyon wall on the way back.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedVallesValentus = The massive canyon walls surround your vessel, dwarfing the craft with their sheer scale.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoes = This seems dangerous.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedJebbedusMontes = The craft shudders as a quake rocks it. It may be best to reconsider your choice of Nem as a vacation destination.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = You do a double-take as you look out the window. That view can't possibly be real.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedPlateaus = Well. It's flat.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedMesas = Two words: Race. Track. Make it happen.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = For being a polar region, this place sure does look like just an ordinary desert.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOases = The waters are exceptionally calm, and the craft bobs very gently. You can see tiny fishlike alien animals swimming past the window!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCrater = The lake outside the window is sparkling in the twilight, and alien life flits through the shimmering waters.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = These waters are surprisingly clear. There must be some kind of ongoing process that's filtering out the sand.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowDuneSeas = Dunes, dunes, dunes... As far as the eye can see.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowWhiteDeserts = OW! Okay, don't look outside unless you like having your eyes seared! Dang it!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowMariaAll = You wonder what makes this region darker than the others. Exposed rock? Or perhaps it's darker, heavier sand?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowCraters = These craters are pretty subtle. The wind must be weathering them.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowCraterOases = Wait, is that grass? Are those trees?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowCalderasAll = The cabin heaters audibly whirr as they start to work overtime. Let's not fly lower.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowVolcanoes = Just imagining the kind of boom that made that is making you giddy.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowJebbedusMontes = Now THAT is a volcano! Surely it's bigger than the KSC peninsula! By many orders of magnitude, even.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowTatooaCrater = This is why we have a space program.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowCanyons = Flying through a canyon on an alien planet may have been your dream growing up, so you're very happy right now.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowVallesValentus = Just like Beggar's... what? No, I wasn't quoting anything.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowPlateaus = These plateaus are rather flat. Probably created by lava flow or something, I don't know.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingLowMesas = Those trenches would make for a PERFECT race track. Just imagine the crazy cars Jeb could take for wild joyrides here.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_FlyingHigh = Wow, this atmosphere goes pretty high up!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_InSpaceLow = Just imagine the big boom those volcanoes will make when they go off, huh? We're not... staying, are we?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_InSpaceHighNoPrincipia = Gilly is a little too close to Nem for comfort. How sure are we that it's going to stay there?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_crewReport_Nem_InSpaceHighPrincipia = Compared to the big purple giant over there, Nem looks positively inviting. Reminds you a bit too much of the Badlands, though.
	
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedDuneSeas = Is there a Dune Kraken swimming through these seas out there somewhere? Perhaps you should get back inside before you find out.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedWhiteDeserts = Your chances of being swallowed by a colossal worm are low, but never zero.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoCalderas = Do you smell something burning?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedJebbedusCaldera = Whew. Good thing I'm indestructible.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedMaria = "Whoever controls this sand, controls... this sand."
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedAbydaMare = A distant rumbling deep below bothers you. Mission Control says it's probably just a minor quake, but you can't get the thought of sandworms out of your mind.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedCraters = Nem's shallower craters are rather unimpressive. You suppose that's to be expected with all the wind erosion, though.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = After analyzing the atmosphere, Mission Control lets you take off your helmet. It's sweltering here, but survivable. The air is a little thin, though it's definitely breathable. More importantly- it's been too long since you've breathed fresh air!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedCanyons = The towering canyon walls look a little too steep to climb, even considering the low gravity.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedVallesValentus = You feel very small indeed.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoes = Smoke trails far overhead as the volcano grumbles below. This is awesome.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedJebbedusMontes = The ground beneath you rumbles, and you start to get excited before you realize you're well within the blast radius.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = You notice something is fogging up the glass on your helmet, and realize your jaw has been hanging open. This must be one of the best views in the entire solar system.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedPlateaus = Those cliffs are pretty steep. You make sure to watch your footing.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedMesas = Heh heh heh... "Buttes".
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = Is this sand, or snow? Mm... Nope. Tastes like sand.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOases = The water here is incredibly clear- to the point you have to wonder just how this is possible.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCrater = The water around you is sparkling in the dim twilight, and Eve librates slowly overhead. Can we build a vacation resort here? Like, now?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = You'd think water at the bottom of a canyon would be dark and murky, but no- it's crystal-clear.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_FlyingLowGeneric = This was an ill-advised plan at best, to be sure.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_FlyingLowVolcanoCalderas = If you parachuted over this, what are the odds you'd catch an updraft and soar to safety?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_FlyingLowJebbedusCaldera = This is THE most precarious situation.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_FlyingLowCraterOases = Maybe you can parachute all the way down to the water?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_FlyingLowTatooaCrater = This would be the perfect place for extreme skydiving.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_FlyingHigh = The thin atmosphere doesn't change the fact that this is a terrible idea.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowGeneric = It looks pretty hot down there. Did we pack enough sunscreen?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowCanyons = These deep fissures seem to have been created by some pretty serious geological activity.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowVallesValentus = Canyons this deep and wide just don't exist on Kerbin. You've got to find out what flying through it is like!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowVolcanoes = These volcanoes are huge! Nem must be getting kneaded like a ball of dough.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowMesas = We need to get down there and fly through those trenches. For research purposes, of course.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowJebbedusMontes = WOW. You don't think you've ever seen a volcano that big before in your life. And it's active, too...
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowCraterOases = Are your eyes playing tricks on you, or are those craters covered in green?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceLowTatooaCrater = That place has to have a phenomenal view. Can we land there?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_evaReport_Nem_InSpaceHigh = Unlike Eve, Nem has a surface you can actually see. And for a desert world, it's got a lot going on.

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfLandedSandy = The Goo tries to flick the sand off of its body, but it's stuck!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfLandedRocky = The heat of the air is starting to get to the Goo, which has begun dripping with... more Goo.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfLandedWhiteDeserts = The Goo is shielding its... eyes?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = The Goo seems to be enjoying the fine mist.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = The Goo is peeking out of its container, staring at Eve and the sun above.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfLandedCalderas = The Goo has transcended its semifluid state and appears to be skipping straight to plasma.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOases = The Goo finds the temperature here comfortable, and enjoys soaking in the warm water.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCrater = This chilly water is a little too cold for the Goo's liking.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = The Goo seems to dislike the hot water at first, but gradually grows accustomed to it.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_FlyingLow = The Goo is fanning itself.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_FlyingLowCalderas = The Goo is fanning itself, VIGOROUSLY.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_FlyingLowCraterOases = The Goo presses up against the edge of its container, fascinated by the view below.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_FlyingLowTatooaCrater = The Goo has become quite interested in the view outside, but the wind is still too intense for it to check.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_FlyingHigh = The Goo would much prefer if you closed its container now.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_InSpaceLow = The Mystery Goo appears to be indicating that it prefers Eve.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_InSpaceHighNoPrincipia = The Goo is concerned that we're going to hit Gilly.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Nem_InSpaceHighPrincipia = The Goo is concerned that this sunlight will dry out its membrane.

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedDuneSeas = It would seem Kerbin and Nem have a lot more in common than you thought. They both have the same sand.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedWhiteDeserts = This sand owes its eye-scorching white color to a quartz-rich composition.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedMariaAbydaMare = The sand in this region appears to be comprised of particles which are rich in carbon, explaining their darker coloration.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedCraters = A greater concentration of rare metals in this sample indicates that yep, this is a crater alright. Glad we figured that one out.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = The plant life here is unlike anything on Kerbin. It is brightly-colored and unusually blue-tinted, probably to help protect against the intense visible light and UV radiation more effectively.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesPlateaus = The surface here is comprised of igneous rock that appears to have been deposited by the flow of lava. Obviously.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedCalderas = You would take a sample, but it appears that your glove is melting off. Or is that your hand?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedVallesValentus = The bottom of this enormous canyon is quite rocky and barren, but areas near water have signs of a kind of algae-like plant growing around it.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedCanyons = Large rocks and pebbles have presumably rolled down here from the canyon walls, giving this area an eclectic surface composition. Good thing you like cool rocks!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = Plants here are bright and tinted blue, like elsewhere on Nem- but their tissues have sustained far less damage, probably because of the limited sunlight this crater receives.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedMesas = A relatively thin layer of silicate sand coats this region, which is otherwise covered by solidified lava flows.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = The surface here seems to be pretty much the same as the Dune Seas. There's no evidence of water ice, as far as you can tell.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfSplashedOasesAll = This water is incredibly clear. It appears that organisms in the water are absorbing the silicon-rich soil to protect themselves against solar radiation, turning it crystal clear!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_surfaceSample_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = The water here is surprisingly clear. Despite the relative desolation surrounding these scattered lakes, they're full of life which is absorbing the rock in the water for protection, which would've made it murky.

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfLandedGeneric = The materials do not seem to appreciate the extreme heat. Some of them are melting!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = The animal 'samples' appear almost comfortable when exposed to this environment. It seems this is prime real estate for a tropical resort!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = Though the temperature here can get quite low during the night, the water sample does not freeze. It might be a different story at the poles.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = The water sample begins to freeze during the long polar night, but as the sun rises the temperature rises and it melts again.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOases = A small, glowing yellow squid escapes from the materials bay and into the water! So that's where Squishy went...
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCrater = Some of the living samples appear to be getting rather chilly in the cool water here.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = The samples react in much the same way that they would to being submerged in warm water at altitude on Kerbin.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_FlyingLow = The turbulence knocks the samples in the bay around, and by the time the bay is closed they're covered in sand.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_FlyingHigh = The thin atmosphere at this altitude is actually rather cold, and the materials react accordingly.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Nem_InSpace = As expected, the materials samples react to space near Nem in much the same way as space literally anywhere else...

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = Though the temperature would normally be able to reach up to 338K here, 64.4 degrees Kelsius, or 148 Kermanheit, it falls short because of the cooling effect the lake and grass are having on the air. This place is pretty nice, all things considered.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Temperatures here can get absolutely sweltering, with the hottest recorded ranging around 338k. The canyons do not appear to be very habitable.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = It's actually a bit on the chilly side here, but it still never quite gets cold enough to freeze the water.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedDuneSeas = At the height of day here, temperatures can get hotter than even the highest recorded temperature on Kerbin- but not by much. This planet may actually be habitable!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedGeneric = Nem can become truly sweltering during the day, and despite the long nights they aren't long enough for the temperature to drop too much. It's not a furnace like Eve is, though... This is actually quite manageable with some radiators, or just good ol' Kerbal hardiness. A colony may be a great idea!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedMareAll = This dark mare seems to be getting hotter than the rest of the surface, probably due to the reduced albedo.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = Despite the fact that during the night it can get cold enough to just about freeze ice, daytime temperatures are still above the freezing point, so no ice caps have formed. The sand here is also probably a little salty.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesAll = For the most part, the volcanoe isn't any hotter than the rest of Nem. You'd have to get dangerously close to the caldera to notice much of a change.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = The readout just says "YES".
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOases = The water here is not as hot as expected. This is probably due to the cooling effects of the lake itself and the surrounding plantlife.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCrater = This water is chilly for sure, but it never quite reaches the freezing point.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = The water in Nem's deepest canyons is very hot for most of the day, but still survivable.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_Nem_FlyingLow = Temperature rapidly increases the lower you fly. 
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_Nem_FlyingHigh = Nem's upper atmosphere is pretty cold. This helps to explain how it's able to retain so much nitrogen.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_temperatureScan_Nem_InSpace = Noooope. Still quite impossible. R&D guys are still thinking about it.

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_SrfLandedGeneric = Nem has quite a lot of atmospheric pressure for its size, but it doesn't vary too much with altitude. That's probably because of how tall the atmosphere is; the pressure gradient is a minor factor on the surface.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_SrfLandedOasesAll = At this altitude, pressure approaches about 0.56 atmospheres. That's thick enough for Kerbals to breathe, as long as there's enough oxygen!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Pressure here is close to 0.56 atmospheres. The high temperature will make flying here a bit harder, though.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesPlateausAll = The air pressure here is a little low, but not as much as one might expect. Nem's tall atmosphere means that pressure varies little across its surface.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = That would be... Six, roughly... Seven.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_FlyingLow = This pressure is actually starting to look reasonable. Judging by the molar mass, there's probably a lot of nitrogen and oxygen. A more detailed analysis would be a good idea.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_FlyingHigh = The air up here is very thin, but perhaps most surprisingly, it stretches up very far indeed. You suppose low gravity and a lot of atmosphere will do that.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_barometerScan_Nem_InSpace = Why?

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedSandy = Nem's sandy surface doesn't carry seismic waves very well, but even here distant low-frequency rumblings indicate persistent geological activity.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedMesas = At the perimeter of Nem's many enormous volcanoes, powerful vibrations can be heard- some of which are even possible for a Kerbal to feel. These are definitely active, if the glowing calderas and smoke plumes didn't give it away already.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesAll = The surface here is constantly vibrating at a low frequency, not detectable by a Kerbal. It appears this volcano is still very much active.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedJebbedusMontes = This monstrous supervolcano is giving off intense vibrations. According to the eggheads in the lab, they suspect it may erupt some time within the next century. Maybe this isn't a great place for a colony after all. The damage would be apocalyptic!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyons = The rocky surface reveals a lot of data about the region's seismic activity, but most of it appears to originate from the nearby volcano.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedVallesValentus = Seismic activity in this region seems to be mostly coming from the nearby volcanoes.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = Seismic readings are challenging to take, as the accelerometer is presently melting into slag and function has been impaired somewhat.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedOases = These crater oases appear to be calmer than the surroundings of volcanoes, but the surface still vibrates with clear signs of geological activity. It's possible there may be aquifers far below with hydrothermal vents.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_seismicScan_Nem_SrfLandedPolesTatooaCrater = Seismic activity in the polar regions is rather low, as most of the forces seem to be concentrated in equatorial regions.

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_SrfLandedGeneric = Gravioli, gravioli, give me the science-oli! Nem's gravitational pull appears to be around 0.458g on the surface, a comfortable value between Duna and Laythe.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesAll = The readings here are actually at their lowest, as intense volcanic activity seems to have formed an enormous magma chamber far below, and displaced much of the rock that was here previously.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsOasesAll = Gravioli readings suggest that gravity reaches its peak in the lower regions of Nem, despite how much of the surface is currently above the sensor. 
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = The device seems to have become convinced it has detected positive gravioli particles, and informs you that the warranty is now void.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_InSpaceLow = Graviolis in this region of space confirm that Nem is a bit too hefty to really be a moon of Eve- it's even heavier than Duna! This would place the barycenter that both bodies orbit somewhere outside of Eve's surface, which makes Nem and Eve a pair of binary planets.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_InSpaceHighNoPrincipia = Gravity readings at this altitude suggest most orbits here would be unstable long-term, which makes Gilly's presence in a mostly stable orbit a miraculous thing. Any closer and it'd have been torn apart or hit the surface; any farther and it would've been shot off into interplanetary space!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_InSpaceHighPrincipia = Gravity readings at this altitude suggest most orbits here would be unstable, and given that you're running Principia, this is probably something you should actually be concerned about. Oh, I shouldn't be talking about that, should I...?
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_gravityScan_Nem_InSpaceHighAlternis = Gravity readings at this altitude suggest many orbits in Eve's SOI would be unstable long-term, so it's a good thing Eve doesn't have any moons, huh?

		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Nem_SrfLandedGeneric = Completing the atmospheric analysis reveals its composition. 76% nitrogen, 20% oxygen, 2.9% carbon dioxide, 1% argon, and 0.1% water vapor. Very similar to Kerbin!
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Nem_SrfLandedOasesAll = Nem's atmosphere here appears to be a tad more oxygenated than the rest of the planet. It appears these oases produce more oxygen than the desert grasses in drier regions.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Nem_FlyingLow = Nem't atmosphere is wetter than expected, and the proportion of oxygen seems to be quite similar to Kerbin. Landing would allow for a more precise analysis to be done.
		#LOC_Nem_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Nem_FlyingHigh = At this altitude, Nem's atmosphere has already made itself apparent. Initial analysis suggests a lot of nitrogen and oxygen.

		// DMagic Orbital Science
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_magScan_Nem_SrfLandedGeneric = From the surface, Nem's magnetic field lines mostly run north-south, but slow fluctuations in the readings indicate that molten magnetized rock may be flowing deep below.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_magScan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesAll = Nem's huge volcanoes seem to have dragged up magnetized iron-rich minerals from deep below, giving them powerful localized magnetic fields.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_magScan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = It was working really well, until it melted.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_magScan_Nem_SrfLandedCraters = Heavier metals scattered about this crater are producing small localized magnetic fields, these are likely either pieces of impact ejecta or natural ore partially exposed by the impact.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_magScan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = The readings reveal localized magnetic fields that indicate the presence of abundant iron ore deposits in the canyon walls.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_magScan_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = Readings suggest that Nem's magnetic field is closely aligned with the geographical poles, as the lines are nearly vertical here.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_rpwsScan_Nem_InSpaceLow = Nem lacks detectable radiation belts, much like Eve- likely due to being protected by both powerful fields.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_rpwsScan_Nem_InSpaceHigh = Charged particles from the solar wind are being deflected strongly by Nem's rather powerful magnetic field, but Eve's own large field is doing a lot of legwork too.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowDuneSeas = These massive rolling dunes stretch on and on for kilometers in every direction!
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowWhiteDeserts = The exposure settings have to be toned down to photograph this region- the sand here is extremely bright.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowAbydaMare = This enormous mare covers nearly an entire hemisphere by itself. It must be awful down there- but as bad as the Badlands? Hmm...
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowMaria = The cause of the darker color in these wide, dark maria eludes you. A more specialized instrument may be necessary to determine that. Pizza crust? No, surely not. Unless...
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowCraters = Nem's craters are mostly sparse and large. This is probably due to a combination of its relatively thick atmosphere and volcanic resurfacing. Also, some may be buried in sand.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowCraterOases = Green? Do your eyes deceive you? It's a kind of blue-green color, but... Could that be plant life? The telescope reveals the shadows of what may be trees...
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowVolcanoes = These volcanoes dwarf anything on Kerbin by quite a large margin. Any one of them could probably qualify as a supervolcano.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowVolcanoCalderas = Looks like a nice place. We should definitely land in there! ...For legal reasons, that was a joke.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowJebbedusMontes = That has to be the largest volcano you've ever seen. Probably the biggest ever discovered. The boom that thing will make is kind of a terrifying thought. You'd probably be able to spot the aftermath from a telescope on Kerbin.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowJebbedusCaldera = Probably a bad idea to try flying into that caldera, but you've heard worse ideas. An intern once suggested landing on the Sun "at night".
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowVallesValentus = That's one heck of a canyon. It's easily bigger than anything on Kerbin by a good few orders of magnitude; it'd probably be fun to fly around down there!
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowCanyons = Nem's canyons are all pretty big and pretty deep. The locations would appear to suggest they were formed by geological activity from the nearby volcanoes.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowTatooaCrater = This near-polar crater lake is the largest crater on Nem by far, and still has liquid water despite the lower temperature. The view of Eve and the sun from there must be spectacular.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowPlateaus = These colossal volcanic plateaus seem to have been formed by ancient lava flows, and then weathered by wind.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowMesas = Oh, you HAVE to build a race track there. Jebediah wouldn't rest until it gets done.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceLowPoles = Nem's poles have a conspicuous lack of ice caps. It's a desert world, so perhaps that's expected, but at its albedo and pressure ice should be almost possible here- unless the sand is salty.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_Nem_InSpaceHigh = This bright, sandy desert planet reminds one of cheese. You're sure the headlines this picture will generate will be comparing it to cheese. And... now you want pizza.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowDuneSeas = Multispectral scans confirm that this is, in fact, sand. And not weird alien sand either- just sand.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowWhiteDeserts = Spectral analysis suggests these deserts may be white because of a quartz-rich composition.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowAbydaMare = This dark surface is more carbon-rich than the rest of Nem, explaining the darker color, but there may also be regions which are more rocky than sandy- especially towards the center.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowMaria = The dark surface here seems to be a bit more carbon-rich than the rest of Nem, explaining the darker sand.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowCraters = These craters seem to be produced by a variety of types of meteorite; mostly stony, some metallic, and a few carbonaceous.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowCraterOases = Multispectral analysis shows these green areas are quite reflective in the UV spectra, and absorb only a few very specific wavelengths of light. This would appear to suggest the existence of plants adapted to the intense sunlight, but surface exploration will have to be done to confirm this.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowVolcanoes = Infrared scans confirm very high levels of activity in this region, though a visible light analysis of the glowing caldera and massive smoke plume would've told you that too.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowCalderasAll = The lava in this caldera looks to be metal-rich, suggesting some of it was brought up to the surface from deep below.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowJebbedusMontes = This titanic supervolcano is covered in infrared hotspots, suggesting subsurface magma flows and a lot of activity. It can't be long before Jebbedus Montes goes boom!
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowVallesValentus = Gas emissions in this region suggest ongoing geological activity in the region; which makes sense given it's right next to the largest, most active volcano on Nem.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowCanyons = These canyons appear to be much less geologically active than the nearby volcanoes, according to the IR scans.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowTatooaCrater = This massive crater near the poles appears to have been metallic in composition, according to UV and IR analysis of the surface. Much of it is covered in a conspicuous green substance that reflects UV light and absorbs only a few wavelengths, however- suggesting it may be plantlife that is mostly adapted to bright light.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowPlateaus = Nem's volcanic plateaus are as active as the volcanoes themselves, with the presence of various hotspots suggesting new volcanoes may be close to forming.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowMesas = No unusual volcanic activity is detected in IR scans of the mesas, indicating they were separated from the plateau by erosion and not volcanic activity.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceLowPoles = Nem's poles are rather chilly in the IR spectra, but no water is detected on the surface.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Nem_InSpaceHigh = Imaging Nem in all spectra shows a hot desert planet, covered in silicate sand and overflowing with volcanic activity. Oxygen detected in the atmosphere may indicate the presence of life on the surface despite the conditions, but further analysis would have to be done to confirm this.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmSIGINT_Nem_InSpaceLow = Constant radio activity is generated by interactions between Nem's atmosphere and the solar wind- well, what little of it can pierce Eve and Nem's magnetospheres, anyway.
		
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmReconScan_Nem_InSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Nem's northern hemisphere is dominated mostly by light sand dunes, but a massive crater in the region filled with greens and blues catches your interest.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmReconScan_Nem_InSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = The southern hemisphere of Nem is darker, owing to the presence of more maria, craters and canyons on this half of the planet.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Nem_SrfLandedDry = The sensor picks up a faint hydrogen signal, similar to the readings we got when calibrating the sensor in Kerbin's deserts. It is fairly salty, however.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Nem_SrfLandedOasesAll = This soil is very, very wet indeed, as the nearby body of water inundates the soil. Organic compounds found in the grass-like plants covering the surface no doubt also comprise a large part of the hydrogen reading.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Some of the lowest areas seem to have accrued fairly large bodies of water, probably filtered in from the groundwater. Higher regions are much drier.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = Nem's poles do not appear to contain more water than the other regions, despite the low temperatures.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedDuneSeas = Composition of Nem's yellowest sands reveals a similar composition to the deserts of Kerbin, with a fair quantity of quartz.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedWhiteDeserts = The White Deserts have a much more quartz-rich composition than the lower regions, explaining their bright color.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedMariaAll = Nem's maria are covered in carbon-rich sand that contains relatively little quartz, which helps to explain its darker color.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedCraters = Samples from this region show evidence of rapid melting, as expected from impact craters.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = This sample contains many complex organic compounds, some of which are still trying to grow during the X-ray analysis!
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesAll = Rock samples from Nem's volcanoes are comprised of basaltic lava, which is really about what you expected. The rock is relatively iron-rich, however.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = The instrument has already melted too much for the drill to deploy properly...
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedVallesValentus = Basaltic rock found in this deep canyon indicates it may be an ancient rift valley, and its proximity to two huge volcanoes is no coincedence.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedCanyons = Basaltic rock indicates a volcanic past for this canyon, but like many others on Nem, it has formed in such a way that doesn't obviously connect it to any nearby volcanoes, suggesting it is far older than said volcanoes.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = Analysis of this surface shows many complex organic compounds, which are still developing and changing in the sample chamber- a nuisance to the analysis, but clear evidence of life!
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedPlateaus = This plateau is composed of basaltic lava, likely of the same type as the volcano proper. It's probable these were formed by lava flows from previous eruptions.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedMesas = The ground here is peppered with ash and basaltic rock, clearly originating from the nearby volcano.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = Little appreciable water can be detected in this sample, suggesting Nem's poles lack even a layer of permafrost. This is probably because of the fact that these poles only just barely get cold enough to freeze water, and the sand is a little salty.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedDuneSeas = The laser ablates several outer layers of silicates from the surface to reveal... more silicates. Wait... Did you just get deja vu?
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedWhiteDeserts = Chemical composition of the white deserts does not seem to differ substantially from lower regions, suggesting the bright color may be a structural property.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedMariaAll = These dark maria are comparatively rich in carbon compounds, likely the reason for their color.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedCraters = Traces of heavy metals are detected in this impact basin, amongst all the sand no doubt blown here by the wind.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedOasesAll = The surface emits a puff of steam as the laser blasts it, an indication that it is quite wet.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesPlateausAll = Chemical analysis of the surface in this area suggests it's likely mostly made up of basaltic rock, but there's also evidence of sulfur and other volcanic compounds on the surface.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = The laser does not appear to melt the lava for some strange, unknown reason.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Chemical scans show that more carbon-rich sand has gathered at the bottom of this canyon, but it's also colored this way because of the exposed volcanic rock.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedMesas = More silicates are found in this area than areas further into the volcano, probably blown here by the wind.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = No evidence of water ice of any kind is found here- and if it were to be found anywhere on Nem, this is surely where it would be.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Nem_SrfSplashed = Analysis indicates this substance is in fact water- and surprisingly pure water, at that. Some sort of process- likely biological- must be filtering out the soil, which would explain why it's so incredibly clear.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Nem_InSpaceLow = Traces of nitrogen and oxygen hint at the composition of Nem's large atmosphere, but the collectors don't detect much else.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Nem_InSpaceHigh = Eve and Nem's powerful magnetic fields block most of the solar wind, so the collectors aren't picking up much at this altitude.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Nem_InSpaceLow = Strong microwave readings can be found all over Nem, a surprising discovery- this would suggest massive aquifers hidden deep below!
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Nem_InSpaceHigh = Nem has a very high albedo most of the time, owing to its bright sandy surface. However, when its massive mare rotates into the sunlight, its albedo suddenly drops.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Nem_SrfLandedSandy = The sand does a great job of absorbing all the seismic waves, rendering the instrument effectively useless in this environment.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Nem_SrfLandedRocky = This rocky ground carries seismic waves quite well, showing a vastly complex interior full of magma flows, lava tubes, and what must be enormous underground aquifers.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = Fortunately, your craft has the best heat shielding of all- the debug menu! Unfortunately, the lava is too thick and squishy to acquire a useful reading.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Nem_SrfLandedOasesAll = The soft surface makes gathering seismic data difficult, but readings suggest most of Nem's crater oases exist in regions of relatively low volcanic activity.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Nem_SrfLandedPoles = Seismic reflections carry poorly in this region, as any other sandy part of Nem- but from what you can gather, there is no evidence of water ice below the surface.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOasesShallow = The sparkling waters are mesmerizing to watch; more entrancing however are the small animals flitting about the lake. Their exoskeletons are bright and reflective; likely reinforced by silicon taken in from the water. None are larger than a Kerbal's head.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Nem_SrfSplashedCraterOasesDeep = The deepest waters in Nem's oases still aren't all that deep, all things considered- Kerbin's oceans are far deeper. Light down here is still fairly good, so animal life resembles brighter waters closely. The water is, however, much cooler.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Nem_SrfSplashedCanyonsAll = The shallow water of Nem's canyons is populated with sparse aquatic life. The deepest lakes appear to be the most active; possibly because they may be connected to underground rivers that the animals travel through.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCraterShallow = This enormous oasis is a pristine haven for life on Nem, far from the volcanic tyranny of the equatorial regions. The largest organisms recorded on Nem to date swim here, a few of which are even the size of a Kerbal!
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Nem_SrfSplashedTatooaCraterDeep = The deepest waters of Nem's biggest crater oasis are comparatively frigid, especially considering the lack of volcanic activity to heat the water here. Still, the native life appears unbothered by these things.
		
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Nem_SrfLandedDeserts = Despite the desolation, simple desert grasses and small animals survive here. The soil, meanwhile, is much more active- though the scarcity of water means death comes very easily in the dunes.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Nem_SrfLandedVolcanoesPlateausAll = There are almost no signs of life on the slopes of Nem's volcanoes. Although extremophile bacteria thrive off of the temperatures and volcanic gases, nothing else can tolerate the hot and dry conditions.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Nem_SrfLandedCalderasAll = Yes. Surely THIS is where you'll find life on Nem.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Nem_SrfLandedCraterOases = The blue-green soil here is teeming with life. The wet, hot conditions seem to be perfect for the native life, which has come to thrive in the crater oases. Small, reflective insectoid creatures no bigger than a Kerbal's head can be seen in the craft's camera feed, darting through the grass.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Nem_SrfLandedTatooaCrater = This cool crater is home to some of the most unique life on Nem. The lower temperatures have produced specialized species which appear to be exclusive to this crater, judging by their darker, more matte carapaces. They have also grown larger, though this is probably not due to island gigantism- as underground rivers connect the crater to other regions.
		#LOC_Nem_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Nem_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Although barren, Nem's canyons play host to life all the same. Indeed, the lowest parts of these canyons contain drinkable water, and so they have become hotspots of activity for the various small, roaming creatures that inhabit the dunes high above. Up on the cliffs, flying creatures that soar with undulating movements and six buzzing wings roost in the shade.
	
		// Tarsier Space Technology
		#LOC_Nem_TST_Nem_SpaceTelescope = Looks sandy. And what's up with those green pixels? Did someone spill salad on the lens?
		
		// ResearchBodies
		#LOC_Nem_ResearchBodies_Discovery = Initially thought to be a moon of Eve, we quickly realized this object performs an intricate dance with the purple planet. They're more like two planets than a planet and moon- and as such, the new object must be a planet in its own right. Its codename was Nem- an acronym which stands for "New Eve Moon"- but we've grown quite attached to the name.
