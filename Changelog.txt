v1.1.0
Updated Nem's surface features to remove the obvious features lifted straight off of Mars, and replaced them with newer, more original ones.
Valles Valentus has notably moved, grown even longer, and gained a huge river.

v1.2.0
Desaturated the color of the flora on Nem a fair bit.
Removed the unused Career folder.

v1.2.1
Tweaked the Sigma Dimensions support to instead dynamically read your rescale settings, and modify values accordingly.
This means Nem now supports every possible rescale config.
